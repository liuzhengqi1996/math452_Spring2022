# - Introduction to Machine Learning and Its Successes
# - Deep Learning, Deep Concern
# - A First Glance to Mathematics of Deep Learning
# - What Will We Study in This Course

# ## Four major methods of scientific research
# - Experimental Science
# - Theoretical Science
# - Computational Science
# - Data Science

# ## The era of the artificial intelligence
# 

# ## Success Stories - I: Image Classification
# - In 1998, LeCun etc. proposed the neural network
# LeNet-5 based on the convolution and applied to
# the hand-written digits recognition successfully.
# Hence LeNet-5 is also called the first convolutional
# neural network(CNN) successfully applied.
# - In 2012, Hinton and his student Alex joined the
# graph recognition competition by ImageNet and
# improved the accuracy significantly with the CNN
# AlexNet.
# - In 2013 Google purchased a Canadian startup
# company on neural network, DNNResearch. It’s
# set up by Geoffrey Hinton and his graduate students
# Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever in 2012.
# - In 2015, Kaiming He etc. proposed the ResNet
# CNN structure, which has become a state-of-art
# CNN structure and widely used in industry and
# discussed in academia.
# - Afterwards CNN is widely used in the field of
# computer vision and breaks the records
# ceaselessly.

# ## Success Stories - II: AlphaGo & AlphaZero
# - From 2016 to 2017, the AI program AlphaGo developed by Google DeepMind beat down
# all the Go champions worldwide.
# - 2018 AlphaZero gave a unified principle for many other board games
# - The CEO of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis announced to integrate AlphaGo with
# medical, robots and so on. They can learn by themselves since they are artificial
# intelligence, and transfer learning can be done with enough data.

# ## Success Stories - III: Auto-driving
# - In 2009, Google proposed the plan to replace
# human driving with softwares. Afterwards,
# many large technology companies such as
# Tesla, Google, Uber and Benz devoted a lot
# on investigating the technology of automated
# driving.
# - There are about dozens of companies focus
# on automatic drive techniques from L2 to L4.
# - In many countries, road examination
# autonomous vehicles are allowed with
# applications.
# - Tesla – Autopilot; Google – Waymo; Baidu –
# Apollo; GM – Cruise; Volkswagen – DAS
# Autonomy...
